## But Wait - You Need to Deploy the Backend Too!

Your app has **two parts**:

### 1. Frontend (Next.js) ‚Üí Deploy to Vercel ‚úÖ
You're doing this now. Fix above solves the error.

### 2. Backend (Express) ‚Üí Deploy to Railway ‚ö†Ô∏è
You need to deploy this separately.

## Complete Deployment (5 minutes)

### Option 1: Use Automated Scripts (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Deploy backend first
./deploy-railway.sh

# 2. Deploy frontend
./deploy-vercel.sh
```

The scripts will guide you through everything!

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

Follow the **[Quick Start Guide](DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.md)** (5 minutes)

## Troubleshooting

### "CORS policy has blocked"
‚Üí Set `WEB_ORIGIN` on Railway to your Vercel URL

### "Failed to get token: 500"
‚Üí Check `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set on Railway

### Camera not working
‚Üí Vercel provides HTTPS automatically, should work. Check browser permissions.

### Build still fails
‚Üí Read [DEPLOYMENT_ISSUES_FIXED.md](DEPLOYMENT_ISSUES_FIXED.md)
